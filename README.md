# simple-chat-server-with-client
a very simple java socket chat sever and a WPF client

using Oracle Data base , or you can modify that very easily

tables are in the client repo

register is not available (you may implement that yourself), or you can manually add account and password to the tables

and most SIGNIFICANTLY add a buddy pair to the table if you want to add a buddy 

like this:

insert (account1,account2) & insert (account2,account1)

it still has several bugs dealing the logging messages,you can fix that if you are interested
