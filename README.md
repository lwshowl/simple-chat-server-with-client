# simple-chat-server-with-client
a very simple java socket chat sever and a WPF client

using Oracle data base , or you can modify that very easily

tables are in the client repo

register is not available (you may implement that yourself),or you can manually add an account with a password to the USER 

table

and most significantly ADD A BUDDY PAIR TO THE 'BUDDY' TABLE if you want to add a buddy as follows

insert (account1,account2) & insert (account2,account1)

it still has several bugs dealing with the logging messages,you can fix that if you are interested
